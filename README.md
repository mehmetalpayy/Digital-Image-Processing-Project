# Digital Image Processing Project

This project is an interactive application that allows users to perform various image processing operations on their selected images. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can either upload images from the internet or select images from their local computer. After selecting an image, the GUI presents five buttons that correspond to different image filtering operations.

## Features

- Upload or select images from the local computer.
- Apply different image filters using the provided buttons:
  1. Gaussian Blur: Applies a Gaussian kernel to the image.
  2. Median Filter: Applies a median filter to the image.
  3. Average Filter: Applies an average filter to the image.
  4. Negation: Applies a negation filter to the image, generating the negative version.
  5. Laplacian: Applies a Laplacian filter to the image.

## Contents

The project repository consists of the following files:

- **assets**: Contains sample images showing the original and filtered versions side by side. These images can be used as references or uploaded images for the application.
- **DIP_Presentation.pptx**: Presentation file that explains the project code and demonstrates example filtering results.
- **DIP_Project.pdf**: PDF file that contains a sample version of the project code, runnable in Anaconda.
- **dig-img-process.py**: The raw .py file containing the project code.
- **dig-img-process.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook version of the project code, convenient for Anaconda users.

## Prerequisites

To run this application locally, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- tkinter (for GUI)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install opencv-python numpy tkinter


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mehmetalpayy/Digital-Image-Processing-Project/tree/main.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Digital-Image-Processing-Project

3. Run the application:

python dig-img-process.py

4. The GUI window will appear. You can either upload an image by providing its internet link or select an image from your computer's local directory.

5. After selecting an image, you can click on the corresponding buttons to apply different image filters.

6. The original and filtered image will be displayed at the same time, and you can save it if desired.
